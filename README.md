# AUD Backtest Framework

A modular Python backtesting framework for exploring algorithmic trading strategies, with an emphasis on the AUDJPY and AUDUSD currency pairs.

## ðŸ§  Hypothesis

This project is built around a central hypothesis:

> **AUDJPY functions as a global "risk-on/risk-off" barometer.**  
> During periods of broad market optimism ("risk-on"), the Japanese Yen tends to weaken while the Australian Dollar strengthens, pushing AUDJPY higher.  
> Conversely, in "risk-off" environments, capital flows into safer assets like JPY, driving AUDJPY lower.

By identifying regime shifts in AUDJPY behavior and pairing them with tactical entry/exit logic, this framework aims to exploit short- to medium-term edge through reversion, trend, or volatility strategies.
